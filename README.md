# Introduction 

This github repository contains code to reproduce the analysis in our upcoming paper "Transcriptomic landscape analysis identifies regional biology and tumor heterogeneity in medulloblastoma and uncovers two major unrecognized ependymoma subtypes" from the Holland Lab at Fred Hutch Cancer Center.

The landscape is accessible via Oncoscape, an open-source platform. The figures to the paper can be visualized on Oncoscape in 3D here:

[Oncoscape, for Figures 1 through 5.](https://oncoscape.sttrcancer.org:&project=medulloblastomaumap33)

After the data finishes loading, you can click the blue "Figures from the Paper" dropdown menu to choose a sub-figure.

Figure 6 is an interactive volcano plot where you can look at individual genes of interest and where they land on the volcano plot
